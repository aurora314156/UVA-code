	Sample Input


	"To be or not to be," quoth the Bard, "that
	is the question".
	The programming contestant replied: "I must disagree.
	To `C' or not to `C', that is The Question!"

	Sample Output


	``To be or not to be,'' quoth the Bard, ``that
	is the question''.
	The programming contestant replied: ``I must disagree.
	To `C' or not to `C', that is The Question!''


	大意: 給N個字串 要你按照規則轉換後輸出


	解法: 兩個轉換的符號交替輸出


	import java.util.*;

	public class UVA272 {

	 public static void main(String[] args) {

	  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	  int count = 0;

	  String line;

	  while (sc.hasNext()) {

	   line = sc.nextLine();

	   for (int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) {

		if (line.charAt(i) == '"') {

		 if (count % 2 == 0)
		  System.out.print("``");

		 else
		  System.out.print("''");

		 count++;

		}

		else
		 System.out.print(line.charAt(i));
	   }

	   System.out.println();
